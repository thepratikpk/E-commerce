# Fix Authentication Issue

## Problem Identified
When you refresh the orders page after changing order status in admin, your user gets changed/logged out. This is an **authentication session management issue**.

## Root Causes Found

1. **Missing JWT Import**: The `refreshAccessToken` function was missing the `jwt` import
2. **Token Expiry**: Access tokens expire after 1 day, but refresh mechanism might not work properly
3. **Session Confusion**: Frontend and backend authentication state can get out of sync

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Missing JWT Import
- Added `import jwt from 'jsonwebtoken'` to user controller
- This ensures token refresh works properly

### 2. Enhanced Debugging
- Added comprehensive logging to track authentication flow
- Backend logs show which user is authenticated for each request
- Frontend logs show authentication status changes

### 3. Better Error Handling
- Improved error messages for authentication failures
- Clear logging when tokens expire or become invalid

## Testing Steps

### Step 1: Test Current Behavior
1. Login to frontend
2. Place an order
3. Go to admin panel and change order status
4. Return to frontend orders page and refresh
5. Check browser console for authentication logs

### Step 2: Look for These Debug Messages

**Backend Console:**
```
🔐 Token decoded for user: [USER_ID]
🔐 Authenticated user: { id: [USER_ID], name: [NAME], email: [EMAIL] }
```

**Frontend Console:**
```
🔐 Checking auth status...
🔐 Auth successful: { id: [USER_ID], name: [NAME], email: [EMAIL] }
```

### Step 3: If Issue Persists

If you still see user changes after refresh, check for:

1. **Token Expiry**: Look for "Token expired" messages
2. **Cookie Issues**: Check if cookies are being cleared
3. **CORS Problems**: Verify credentials are included in requests

## Additional Fixes (If Needed)

### Fix 1: Automatic Token Refresh
If tokens are expiring, we can add automatic refresh:

```javascript
// In frontend API utility
const apiCallWithRefresh = async (endpoint, options = {}) => {
  try {
    return await apiCall(endpoint, options);
  } catch (error) {
    if (error.status === 401) {
      // Try to refresh token
      await authAPI.refreshToken();
      // Retry original request
      return await apiCall(endpoint, options);
    }
    throw error;
  }
};
```

### Fix 2: Extend Token Expiry
Change in backend `.env`:
```
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRY=7d  # Instead of 1d
```

### Fix 3: Better Session Management
Add session persistence in frontend:
```javascript
// Store user session in localStorage as backup
localStorage.setItem('userSession', JSON.stringify(user));
```

## Next Steps

1. **Run the enhanced debugging version**
2. **Check console logs** during the problematic flow
3. **Report back** what authentication messages you see
4. **If issue persists**, we'll implement additional fixes based on the logs

The debugging will show exactly when and why the user session changes, allowing us to fix the root cause.
